14) LocalBackend timeout not enforced - FIXED

RESOLVED: The timeout implementation has been fully fixed:

1. Switched from ThreadPoolExecutor to multiprocessing.Process
   - Processes CAN be terminated, unlike threads
   - Uses process.terminate() (SIGTERM) followed by process.kill() (SIGKILL) if needed

2. The wrapper LocalBackend.submit_and_wait() now correctly propagates timed_out:
   - Reads timed_out from inner result.get("timed_out", False)
   - Sets result_state to "TIMEDOUT" when timeout occurs

3. Implementation in execution_backend.py:
   - Module-level _execute_code_in_process() function runs in subprocess
   - Results passed back via multiprocessing.Queue
   - Graceful termination (5s wait) then force kill if still running
   - Error message clearly indicates "(process terminated)"
