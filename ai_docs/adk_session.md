# Session: Tracking Individual Conversations

Following our Introduction, let's dive into the `Session`. Think back to the
idea of a "conversation thread." Just like you wouldn't start every text message
from scratch, agents need context regarding the ongoing interaction.
**`Session`** is the ADK object designed specifically to track and manage these
individual conversation threads.

## The `Session` Object

When a user starts interacting with your agent, the `SessionService` creates a
`Session` object (`google.adk.sessions.Session`). This object acts as the
container holding everything related to that *one specific chat thread*. Here
are its key properties:

*   **Identification (`id`, `appName`, `userId`):** Unique labels for the
    conversation.
    * `id`: A unique identifier for *this specific* conversation thread, essential for retrieving it later. A SessionService object can handle multiple `Session`(s). This field identifies which particular session object are we referring to. For example, "test_id_modification".
    * `app_name`: Identifies which agent application this conversation belongs to. For example, "id_modifier_workflow".
    *   `userId`: Links the conversation to a particular user.
*   **History (`events`):** A chronological sequence of all interactions
    (`Event` objects – user messages, agent responses, tool actions) that have
    occurred within this specific thread.
*   **Session State (`state`):** A place to store temporary data relevant *only*
    to this specific, ongoing conversation. This acts as a scratchpad for the
    agent during the interaction. We will cover how to use and manage `state` in
    detail in the next section.
*   **Activity Tracking (`lastUpdateTime`):** A timestamp indicating the last
    time an event occurred in this conversation thread.

### Example: Examining Session Properties

=== "Python"

       ```py
        from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService, Session

        # Create a simple session to examine its properties
        temp_service = InMemorySessionService()
        example_session = await temp_service.create_session(
            app_name="my_app",
            user_id="example_user",
            state={"initial_key": "initial_value"} # State can be initialized
        )

        print(f"--- Examining Session Properties ---")
        print(f"ID (`id`):                {example_session.id}")
        print(f"Application Name (`app_name`): {example_session.app_name}")
        print(f"User ID (`user_id`):         {example_session.user_id}")
        print(f"State (`state`):           {example_session.state}") # Note: Only shows initial state here
        print(f"Events (`events`):         {example_session.events}") # Initially empty
        print(f"Last Update (`last_update_time`): {example_session.last_update_time:.2f}")
        print(f"---------------------------------")

        # Clean up (optional for this example)
        temp_service = await temp_service.delete_session(app_name=example_session.app_name,
                                    user_id=example_session.user_id, session_id=example_session.id)
        print("The final status of temp_service - ", temp_service)
       ```

*(**Note:** The state shown above is only the initial state. State updates
happen via events, as discussed in the State section.)*

## Managing Sessions with a `SessionService`

As seen above, you don't typically create or manage `Session` objects directly.
Instead, you use a **`SessionService`**. This service acts as the central
manager responsible for the entire lifecycle of your conversation sessions.

Its core responsibilities include:

*   **Starting New Conversations:** Creating fresh `Session` objects when a user
    begins an interaction.
*   **Resuming Existing Conversations:** Retrieving a specific `Session` (using
    its ID) so the agent can continue where it left off.
*   **Saving Progress:** Appending new interactions (`Event` objects) to a
    session's history. This is also the mechanism through which session `state`
    gets updated (more in the `State` section).
*   **Listing Conversations:** Finding the active session threads for a
    particular user and application.
*   **Cleaning Up:** Deleting `Session` objects and their associated data when
    conversations are finished or no longer needed.

## `SessionService` implementations

ADK provides different `SessionService` implementations, allowing you to choose
the storage backend that best suits your needs:

### `InMemorySessionService`

*   **How it works:** Stores all session data directly in the application's
    memory.
*   **Persistence:** None. **All conversation data is lost if the
    application restarts.**
*   **Requires:** Nothing extra.
*   **Best for:** Quick development, local testing, examples, and scenarios
    where long-term persistence isn't required.

=== "Python"

      ```py
        from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
        session_service = InMemorySessionService()
      ```


### `DatabaseSessionService`

<div class="language-support-tag">
  <span class="lst-supported">Supported in ADK</span><span class="lst-python">Python v0.1.0</span><span class="lst-go">Go v0.1.0</span>
</div>

*   **How it works:** Connects to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL,
    MySQL, SQLite) to store session data persistently in tables.
*   **Persistence:** Yes. Data survives application restarts.
*   **Requires:** A configured database.
*   **Best for:** Applications needing reliable, persistent storage that you
    manage yourself.

```py
from google.adk.sessions import DatabaseSessionService
# Example using a local SQLite file:
# Note: The implementation requires an async database driver.
# For SQLite, use 'sqlite+aiosqlite' instead of 'sqlite' to ensure async compatibility.
db_url = "sqlite+aiosqlite:///./my_agent_data.db"
session_service = DatabaseSessionService(db_url=db_url)
```

!!! warning "Async Driver Requirement"

    `DatabaseSessionService` requires an async database driver. When using SQLite,
    you must use `sqlite+aiosqlite` instead of `sqlite` in your connection string.
    For other databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL), ensure you're using an async-compatible
    driver, such as `asyncpg` for PostgreSQL, `aiomysql` for MySQL.

!!! note "Session database schema change in ADK Python v1.22.0"

    The schema for the session database changed in ADK Python v1.22.0, which
    requires migration of the Session Database. For more information, see
    [Session database schema migration](/adk-docs/sessions/session/migrate/).

## The Session Lifecycle

<img src="../../assets/session_lifecycle.png" alt="Session lifecycle">

Here’s a simplified flow of how `Session` and `SessionService` work together
during a conversation turn:

1.  **Start or Resume:** Your application needs to use the `SessionService` to
    either `create_session` (for a new chat) or use an existing session id.
2.  **Context Provided:** The `Runner` gets the appropriate `Session` object
    from the appropriate service method, providing the agent with access to the
    corresponding Session's `state` and `events`.
3.  **Agent Processing:** The user prompts the agent with a query. The agent
    analyzes the query and potentially the session `state` and `events` history
    to determine the response.
4.  **Response & State Update:** The agent generates a response (and potentially
    flags data to be updated in the `state`). The `Runner` packages this as an
    `Event`.
5.  **Save Interaction:** The `Runner` calls
    `sessionService.append_event(session, event)` with the `session` and the new
    `event` as the arguments. The service adds the `Event` to the history and
    updates the session's `state` in storage based on information within the
    event. The session's `last_update_time` also get updated.
6.  **Ready for Next:** The agent's response goes to the user. The updated
    `Session` is now stored by the `SessionService`, ready for the next turn
    (which restarts the cycle at step 1, usually with the continuation of the
    conversation in the current session).
7.  **End Conversation:** When the conversation is over, your application calls
    `sessionService.delete_session(...)` to clean up the stored session data if
    it is no longer required.

This cycle highlights how the `SessionService` ensures conversational continuity
by managing the history and state associated with each `Session` object.
